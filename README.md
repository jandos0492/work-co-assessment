<h3>1. Implement Product Details Page</h3>

- Users should be able to open the product modal from both the homepage and Cart modal, or navigate to a route in the format /product/:productId
- Clicking on the product name or image should open the product modal
- Closing the Product modal should take the user to the homepage, no matter where they came from
- Implement the PDP image picker, so clicking on a thumbnail changes the featured image (no animation/transition between images is required)
- Don't worry about wiring up quantity/Add to Bag buttons
- No specific loading/404 behavior is required, as long as these events do not lead to an error
